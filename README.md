# Taskmaster-Pro

## Description

A company called Taskmaster has recruited me to expand their task-management application. To do this, I will need to work with their existing codebase, which was built using jQuery, a third-party JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation, and the front-end CSS library Bootstrap.
